# Project 1 - A Designer Website using Ruby on Rails

This project is a website that simulates a real-world architectual company's website, which has a home page for the public, and a sign up/login system which enables company's employees to create, read, update, and delete information designers, clients, and projects from the databases. The project is built using Ruby on Rails, and it also utilizes HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, and Heroku platform for deployment. Project was created on Ruby version 2.7.5 and Rails version 5.2.7.

Heroku link to access this website
-------------------------------------------------------
https://archdesign2022.herokuapp.com/  

* User name for login: johnsmith@gmail.com
* Password: chicken
* Or you can choose to Sign up first and use your own user name and password.

CRUD model
-------------------------------------------------------
The whole project is based on the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) model. Currently 4 models have been established in this project, which are
* Users
* Designers
* Clients
* Projects

Further improvement
-------------------------------------------------------
* The current "Contact us" section has no database or model linked. A new model will be created to bring the functionality to this section.
* Will implement Cloudinary to upload and save the images associated with CRUD models.
